                Users can see my post and can mail me in about section which I made using FLASK-MAIL and accordingly I will change the necessary things in my post
</p>
<p>
How did i made this :-
so i first made endpoints/routes that are needed and integrate Mysql with flask using SqlAlchemy then i add some more things like login page for administrator pagination to navigate pages through one page to another. Then i create edit, Delete post/ contact buttons and also add flash to determine if it got updated/deleted also I added logout button for admin users to logout once they are completed with they tasks.
Also i added contact me so that your feedback is received by me and you will get valid response through mail of my feedback being received and also a flash of "Mail sent successfully"
